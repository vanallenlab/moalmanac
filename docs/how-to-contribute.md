# How to contribute
Any changes in this GitHub repository should be made by [creating a new branch](#creating-a-new-branch), committing and pushing changes, [creating a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request), and [merging the pull request](#merging-a-pull-request). [Releases](#creating-a-release) should be generated periodically along with the associated Docker containers.

## Creating a new branch
Before making any changes, [create a new branch](https://www.howtogeek.com/714112/how-to-create-a-new-branch-in-github/). To make a new branch, enter the following on terminal,
```bash
git checkout -b {new-branch-name}
```

Replace `{new-branch-name}` with something short that is self-descriptive. All changes should be made in this GitHub repository. Changes should be [committed](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) and [pushed](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) to the repository frequently.
