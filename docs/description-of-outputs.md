# Common output columns used
Many of these columns are used by several outputs produced by Molecular Oncology Almanac. 

## Identifiers
Most, if not all, table outputs will contain these three columns used to describe the case profiles:
* `patient_id` (str) - the string passed by `--patient_id` to label the given molecular profile
* `tumor_sample_barcode` (str) - label present in MAF for tumor sample
* `normal_sample_barcode` (str) - label present in MAF for normal sample

## Standardized feature columns
Molecular Oncology Almanac standardizes primary descriptors for molecular features into four columns: feature_type, feature, alteration_type, and alteration. 

* `feature_type` describes the data type of the molecular features.
  * Potential values are specified under the section [feature_types] in [config.ini](/moalmanac/config.ini)
  * Examples include: Somatic Variant, Germline Variant, Copy Number, Rearrangement, Microsatellite Stability, Mutational Burden, Mutational Signature, Aneuploidy
* `feature` is the main descriptor used to describe a molecular event. The contents vary by feature type, for first-order genomic events this will be the gene name.
  * Somatic variants: gene name
  * Germline variants: gene name
  * Copy number alterations: gene name
  * Rearrangements: gene name, Molecular Oncology Almanac will process each partner in the fusion separately
  * Microsatellite stability: microsatellite stability status (MSI-High or MSI-Low)
  * Mutational burden: High Mutational Burden, if the mutational burden is deemed to be high
  * Mutational signatures: the specific COSMIC (v2) mutational signature, formatted as "COSMIC Signature (number)"
  * Aneuploidy: Whole-genome doubling, this will only be populated if the `--wgd` value is passed to Molecular Oncology Almanac.
* `alteration_type` is a descriptor to provide more granular detail on the molecular event.
  * Somatic variants: variant classification of the variant (Missense, Nonsense, etc.)
  * Germline variants: variant classification of the variant (Missense, Nonsense, etc.)
  * Copy number alterations: type of copy number event (Amplification or Deletion)
  * Rearrangements: type of rearrangement, Fusion unless otherwise specified
* `alteration` is a further description to state the specific event. 
  * Somatic variants: protein change of the variant
  * Germline variants: protein change of the variant
  * Rearrangements: full fusion, "Gene 1--Gene 2"
  * Mutational signatures: contribution or weight of the mutational signature (range: 0 - 1)

## Datasource bins
Molecular Oncology Almanac will match molecular features to [several datasources](/moalmanac/datasources) based on how closely a given molecular feature matches a catalogued feature. 

### Sorting somatic molecular features
The following datasources are used to sort somatic molecular features. Specifically, we assign a numeric value to each somatic variant, germline variants, copy number alteration, and fusion for each appropriate datasource. 

* Molecular Oncology Almanac (`almanac_bin`):
  * `0`: the molecular feature's gene is not present in the database
  * `1`: the molecular feature's gene is present in the database
  * `2`: the molecular feature matches at least one entry by both feature type and gene
  * `3`: the molecular feature matches at least one entry by feature type, gene, and alteration_type
  * `4`: the molecular feature matches at least one entry by feature type, gene, alteration_type, and alteration
* Cancer Hotspots (`cancerhotspots_bin`):
  * `0`: the molecular feature's gene is not present in the database
  * `1`: the molecular feature's gene is present in the database
  * `2`: the molecular feature matches at least one entry by both gene and protein change
* 3D Hotspots (`cancerhotspots3D_bin`):
  * `0`: the molecular feature's gene is not present in the database
  * `1`: the molecular feature's gene is present in the database
  * `2`: the molecular feature matches at least one entry by both gene and protein change

  * `0`: the molecular feature's gene is not present in the database
  * `1`: the molecular feature's gene is present in the database
  * `2`: the molecular feature matches at least one entry by both gene and protein change

### Clinical and biological relevance
Each molecular feature will also receive a label in the `score_bin` column based on values for each datasource, listed above in ascending order. Molecular features which appear in the Molecular Oncology Almanac will receive labels describing the clinical actionability or biological relevance, depending on how closely the molecular feature matches a catalogued feature. Specifically, the following labels will be applied under the specified conditions:
* `Putatively Actionable`
  * Somatic and germline variants - Gene, variant classification, and protein change match a catalogued variant 
  * Copy number alterations - Gene and copy number direction match a catalogued event
  * Fusions - Both genes involved in a fusion event match a catalogued event
* `Investigate Actionability`
  * Somatic and germline variants - Gene and feature type match a catalogued variant but not variant classification or a specific protein change
  * Copy number alterations - Gene and feature type match a catalogued copy number alteration but not direction
  * Fusions - One gene fusion partner is catalogued as a fusion in Molecular Oncology Almanac but not both
* `Biologically Relevance`
  * The gene(s) associated with the molecular feature is present in Molecular Oncology Almanac but under a different feature type
  
The following second-order molecular features are evaluated in `score_bin` as follows:
* High mutational burden is labeled as `Investigate Actionability` 
* MSI-High is labeled as `Investigate Actionability`
* Whole-genome doubling is labeled as `Investigate Actionability`
* Mutational signatures catalogued by Molecular Oncology Almanac are labeled as `Investigate Actionability` and otherwise labeled as `Biologically Relevant`
* Variants associated with microsatellite instability are listed as "Supporting variants" as `Biologically Relevant`

### Evidence of clinical assertions
If a molecular feature matched as `Putatively Actionable`, or `Investigate Actionability` in Molecular Oncology Almanac, the molecular feature will be associated with clinical evidence. A molecular feature will be matched independently on catalogued events associated with therapeutic sensitivity, therapeutic resistance, and disease prognosis.

#### Associated evidence, Predictive Implication
All catalogued events in Molecular Oncology Almanac are cited and have associated evidence. Evidence tiers are as follows:

|Evidence|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|FDA-Approved|The Food and Drug Association (FDA) recognizes an association between the alteration and recommended clinical action.|
|Guideline|This relationship is catalogued as a guideline for standard of care treatment.|
|Clinical trial|The alteration is or has been used as an eligibility criterion for a clinical trial.|
|Clinical evidence|The relationship is reported in a clinical study that did not directly involve a clinical trial.|
|Preclinical evidence|This relationship is reported in a study involving mice, cell lines, or patient derived models.|
|Inferential evidence|The relationship is inferred as a result of mathematical modeling or an association between molecular features.|

## Mutational burden
Filename suffix: `.mutational_burden.txt`

The mutational burden of a given profile can be computed if somatic variants (`--snv_handle`) and bases covered (`--bases_covered_handle`) are passed to Molecular Oncology Almanac. Somatic insertions and deletions (`--indel_handle`) are also included if they are provided. The mutational burden (also referred to as nonsynonymous mutational burden or coding mutational burden) is calculated by dividing the number of nonsynonymous variants by the number of bases considered for variant calling; Molecular Oncology Almanac uses Missense, Nonsense, Nonstop, Splice Site, Frame Shift, and Insertion and Deletion variants for this calculation.

Molecular Oncology Almanac will attempt to map the provided tumor type (`--tumor_type`) to Oncotree and also an ontology present in TCGA in order to compare the mutational burden relative to TCGA. Columns present in this file are as follows:
- `patient-id` (str) - the string associated with the given molecular profile (`--patient_id`)
- `reported_tumor_type` (str) - the string provided by the user (`--tumor_type`)
- `oncotree_term` (str) - mapped oncotree term for the reported tumor type
- `oncotree_code` (str) - mapped oncotree code for the reported tumor type
- `bases_covered` (int) - number of somatic bases considered for variant calling (`--bases_covered_handle`)
- `n_nonsyn_mutations` (int) - number of somatic coding variants (from `--snv_handle` and `--indel_handle`)
- `coding_mutational_burden_per_megabase` (float) - calculated by dividing `n_nonsyn_mutations` by `bases_covered` and converting the denominator from bases to megabases
- `percentile_tcga` (float, 0-100) - the percentile of `coding_mutational_burden_per_megabase` relative to TCGA from [Lawrence et al. 2013](/moalmanac/datasources/lawrence)
- `percentile_tcga_tissuetype` (float, 0-100) - the percentile of `coding_mutational_burden_per_megabase` relative to a matched TCGA tissue type, if the tumor type matched
- `high_burden?` (boolean, True or False) - boolean value for evaluated mutational burden

Molecular Oncology Almanac designates high mutational burden under two circumstances: 
- Mutations per Mb > 10 
- At least a mutational burden of 80th percentile of TCGA tumor type, if matched, or TCGA generally, if not matched.

## Mutational signatures
Molecular Oncology Almanac runs [deconstructSigs](https://github.com/raerose01/deconstructSigs) as a subprocess based on the MAF file passed with the input argument `--snv_handle`, performing NMF against the 30 COSMIC v2 signatures.

## Profile-to-cell line matchmaking
Filename suffix: `.matchmaker.txt`

Molecular Oncology Almanac performs profile-to-cell line matchmaking on the provided molecular profile, comparing it to a population of cancer cell lines using the genomic profile. For more information, see the publication's Methods section. This file contains three columns:

- `comparison` (str) - the comparison profile being compared to
- `SNF: FDA & CGC` (float) - results from Similarity Network Fusion in ascending order. Rows higher in this list are more similar to the case profile.

## Report
Filename suffix: `.report.txt`

The report is a web-based file generated with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/) used to display results from the `.actionable.txt` output. An example report generated from the data found in [/example_data/](/example_data) is available in [/example_output/](/example_output/example.report.html). If you ran Molecular Oncology Almanac _not_ through Terra or with [run_example.py](/moalmanac/run_example.py), you may need move the report to the outputs folder by running `mv build/index.html report.html`.

The report contains three primary sections: profile information, the actionability report, and comparisons to cancer cell lines.  

The profile information contains metadata provided on the studied molecular profile. Specifically the following items are included: 
- identifiers such as profile id, tumor barcode, and normal barcode
- disease information such as oncotree code, oncotree term, and stage
- metrics such as purity, ploidy, and microsatellite status

The actionability report contains four sections which list variants and features associated with therapeutic sensitivity, therapeutic resistance, prognosis, and biological relevance. This section also features three models, two which describe how the Molecular Oncology Almanac ranks molecular features and another which lists database versions used by the tool. Each molecular feature associated with a clinical assertion will receive its own row in the report along with the following information:
- Associated evidence for the clinical assertion (FDA-Approved, Guideline, Clinical trial, Clinical evidence, Preclinical evidence, Inferential evidence)
- How closely the molecular feature matches the catalogued molecular feature associated with the clinical assertion (Putatively Actionable, Investigate Actionability)
- The feature type associated with the molecular feature
- The molecular feature
- The associated therapy or prognosis, rationale behind the clinical assertion, and a hyperlink to the source

Additional equivalent within a provided ontology or stronger matches from another ontology are available for viewing as a pop up, too, by selecting the `[More Details]` button.

For molecular features associated with therapeutic sensitivity that have a therapy evaluated on cancer cell lines, a button `[Preclinical evidence]` will appear below the therapy and rationale which will open a modal to compare the sensitivity to the therapy of interest between mutant and wild type cell lines.

Molecular features which are biologically relevant are listed without clinical association. Molecular features will appear here if the associated gene is catalogued in the Molecular Oncology Almanac but under a different feature type, variants are associated with microsatellite stability, and all present COSMIC version 2 mutational signatures not associated with a clinical assertion are reported.

The last section of the report, comparison of molecular profile to cancer cell lines, displays results from Molecular Oncology Almanac's patient-to-cell line matchmaking module. **This will not appear in the report if `--disable_matchmaking` is passed as an argument**. The 5 most similar cancer cell lines to the provided profile are listed each listing the cell line name, sensitive therapies from GDSC, and clinically relevant features present. Users can click `[More details]` under each cell line's name for more details about a given cell line: aliases, sensitive therapies, clinically relevant molecular features, all somatic variants, copy number alterations, and fusions occuring in cancer gene census genes, and the 10 most sensitive therapies to the cancer cell line.

## Somatic molecular features
Somatic variants, copy number alterations, and fusions will either be evaluated or filtered by Molecular Oncology Almanac. Criteria for evaluation is as follows:
- Somatic variants: nonsynonymous variants
- Copy number alterations: Within specified [percentiles](/moalmanac/config.ini), if using total copy number
- Fusions: At least the [specified minimum spanning fragments](/moalmanac/config.ini)

### Somatic filtered
Filename suffix: `.somatic.filtered.txt`

Somatic variants, copy number alterations, and fusions not evaluated by Molecular Oncology Almanac will appear in this tab delimited output. Columns included are:

## Validation sequencing image
Filename suffix: `.validation_overlap.png`

If somatic variants from both primary and validation sequencing are provided, the allelic fraction of variants appearing in primary sequencing from both sequencing sources will be plotted on a scatter plot. Variants will be colored and annotated on the scatter plot based on [configurable thresholds](/moalmanac/config.ini). See the publication's Methods section for more details.
