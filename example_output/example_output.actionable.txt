Osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and ZK-58 displayed the highest sensitivity to talazoparib, SaOS-2 and MNNG-HOS displayed intermediate sensitivity, and U2OS cells remained resistant. Cell lines MG63, ZK-58, and MNNG-HOS scored HRD-LOH positive according to a score (Abkevich et al. 2012). MG63 cells harbored copy losses in BAP1, FANCA, and FANCD2 while ZK-58 carried disruptive copy loss in BARD1 and copy gain in FANCD2. SaOS-2 cells harbored copy losses in CHEK2 and TP53 and MNNG-HOS cells have copy loss of ATM and disruptive copy gains in PTEN and FANCD2. The talazoparib-resistant cell line, U2OS, carried a heterozygous BRCA2 copy loss and one intact BRCA2 alelle.	Engert F, Kovac M, Baumhoer D, Nathrath M, Fulda S.
