The Molecular Oncology Almanac utilizes the [American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics report of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing (ACMG SF v3.0)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-021-01172-3) to report incidental and secondary findings from which may be of relevance to the patient. Specifically, alterations in these reported genes are annotated and reported in the germline section of the Molecular Oncology Almanac. 

## About the ACMG
The American College of Medical Genetics report of secondary findings were designed primarily as an educational resource for medical geneticists and other healthcare providers, primarily to promote standardized reporting of actionable information.
